    "To understand the time complexity of a neural network, we need to consider the number of operations, primarily multiplications, required to perform a forward pass through the network. The time complexity is closely related to the architecture of the neural network, particularly the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer.\n",

    "### General Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For a network with $ n $ input features, $ l $ hidden layers with $ h_1, h_2, ..., h_l $ neurons, and $ o $ output neurons, the total number of multiplications can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Total Multiplications} = n \\times h_1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{l-1} (h_i \\times h_{i+1}) + h_l \\times o\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of a forward pass in a neural network can be considered as $ O(\\text{Total Multiplications}) $. If we assume that the number of neurons in each layer is roughly the same, say $ h $, and there are $ l $ hidden layers, the time complexity simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "O(n \\times h + (l-1) \\times h^2 + h \\times o)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, since $ n $, $ h $, and $ o $ are usually constants for a given problem, the time complexity is often dominated by the largest term, which is typically $ O(h^2 \\times l) $ if $ h $ is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input to Hidden Layers**: $ n \\times h $\n",
    "- **Between Hidden Layers**: $ O(h^2 \\times (l-1)) $\n",
    "- **Hidden to Output Layer**: $ h \\times o $\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall time complexity for a forward pass is often summarized as $ O(h^2 \\times l) $, where $ h $ is the average number of neurons per hidden layer and $ l $ is the number of hidden layers."
