    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation of Model Training in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Setup\n",
    "1. **Model Compilation**: Before training, the model is compiled with the following configurations:\n",
    "   - **Optimizer**: Defines the optimization algorithm (e.g., SGD, Adam).\n",
    "   - **Loss Function**: Specifies the loss function to minimize (e.g., mean squared error for regression, categorical cross-entropy for classification).\n",
    "   - **Metrics**: Additional metrics to monitor (e.g., accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['accuracy'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Data**: You have 10,000 training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train = np.random.rand(10000, input_dim)\n",
    "   y_train = np.random.rand(10000, num_classes)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batch Size and Epochs**:\n",
    "   - Batch Size: 1,000\n",
    "   - Epochs: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=1000, epochs=10)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Epoch Loop**: The training process runs for 10 epochs. An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for epoch in range(10):\n",
    "       # Training loop for each epoch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shuffling the Dataset**: At the start of each epoch, the training data is shuffled to ensure the model does not learn the order of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train, y_train = shuffle(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batch Loop**: For each epoch, the dataset is divided into mini-batches of size 1,000. There will be \\( \\frac{10000}{1000} = 10 \\) batches per epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "   - **Extracting the Batch**: Select 1,000 examples from the shuffled dataset.\n",
    "     \n",

    "     predictions = model(X_batch)\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "     loss = loss_function(y_batch, predictions)\n",

    "     gradients = compute_gradients(loss, model.parameters)\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.parameters))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### End of Epoch\n",
    "1. **Metrics Calculation**: At the end of each epoch, the model's performance is evaluated on the training (and optionally validation) set using the specified metrics.\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   train_loss, train_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train)\n",

    "   print(f\"Epoch {epoch+1}/{10} - Loss: {train_loss} - Accuracy: {train_accuracy}\")\n",
